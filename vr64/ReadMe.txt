Robot 64 is an entirely local game written with completely custom player movement and multiplayer replication. 
When the player tells the server their player information for multiplayer replication, it sends individual limb cframes.
This makes it entirely possible to send the server fake limb cframes in order to move the player however the exploiter wants.
I decided I would abuse this by creating VR support. Due to the limitations with the new roblox anticheat & not being able to hack with VR, I had to create my own game (A copy of robot 64).
The VR player would join this game, along with an alt account (this alt had exploits). Another alt would join the main game (this alt also had exploits).
The Alt in the VR players game would send the players VR limb CFrames and send it to the player in the main game, who would then send it to the server.
This alt in the main game would also copy all other players information in the game and send it to the player in my game, which would send it to the server, who would replicate it to the VR player.
This created a seamless transtition between the VR player and the other Players in the game, allowing them to interact together across different games.
